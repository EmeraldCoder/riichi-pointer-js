Riichi Mahjong Pointer
======================

Riichi Mahjong Pointer is a Vue.js application to calculate the score of a winning hand at Riichi Mahjong (Japanese Mahjong).

The application is already able to calculate the points of your mahjong hand, but keep in mind that this application is in beta phase and a lot of features are missing.

If you encounter bugs or points calculation errors, please contact me or add a bug in the github issues section. This way, the application will become more and more stable.
